## QMSim vim syntax highlighting
---------------------------

0. installQMSimSyntax

Use the following to change it an executable:

```
chmod 775 installQMSimSyntax
```

Make sure that `prm.vim` and `prm.vim_ftdetect` are in the same directory (folder). 

Then simply run with:

```
./installQMSimSyntax
```

Contact me with questions if you can't get it to work. I haven't tested it that well.
