# installQMSimSyntax
# 	This bash script will install the syntax highlighting files for QMSim

# 	Note: Please make sure this file is executable with:
#		chmod 775 installQMSimSyntax

# 	Make sure syntax highlighting is turned on in vim with:
# 	:syntax on 
# 	or put this line into .vimrc so you don't have to set it everytime

#==============================================================================#

# Instructions if you want to do it yourself
# 1) Create .vim directory in your home folder (find with echo $HOME)
# 2) Create 2 subdirectories with mkdir
#  		a) syntax
# 		b) ftdetect
# 3) Move prm.vim into the syntax folder
# 4) Move prm.vim_ftdetect into the ftdect folder
# 		a) Rename this file to simply prm.vim
# 5) Make sure all QMSim files have the .prm extension
# 		Otherwise they will not be recognized and not highlighted by vim

#==============================================================================#

# This part will do it for you automatically

# Create needed directories (if it exists, it will not be overwritten)

# Create the .vim directory if needed
if [ -d ~/.vim ]; then
	echo "The ~/.vim directory is present in the home directory."
else
	echo "The ~/.vim directory was not found and will be created for you." 
	mkdir ~/.vim
fi

# Create the .vim/syntax directory if needed
if [ -d ~/.vim/syntax ]; then
	echo "The syntax directory is present in the .vim directory."
else
	echo "The syntax directory was not found and will be created for you."
	mkdir ~/.vim/syntax
fi

# Create the .vim/ftdetet directory if needed
if [ -d ~/.vim/ftdetect ]; then
	echo "The ftdetect directory is present in the .vim directory."
else
	echo "The ftdetect directory was not found and will be created for you."
	mkdir ~/.vim/ftdetect
fi

# Check for both prm.vim and prm.vim_ftdetect files in the current directory
# If not there it will give an error message

# Look for the prm.vim file
if [ -e prm.vim ]; then
	echo "prm.vim file is present in the current working directory."
else
	echo -e "ERROR: The prm.vim file cannot be cound in the current working directory.\n \tPlease make sure the file is present in the current working directory." >&2
	exit 1
fi

# Look for the prm.vim_ftdetect file
if [ -e prm.vim_ftdetect ]; then
	echo "prm.vim_ftdetect file is present in the current working directory."
else
	echo -e "ERROR: The prm.vim_ftdetect file cannot be cound in the current working directory.\n \tPlease make sure the file is present in the current working directory." >&2
	exit 1
fi

# Copy the files into the right directories
	cp prm.vim ~/.vim/syntax/
	cp prm.vim_ftdetect ~/.vim/ftdetect/

# Rename prm.vim_ftdetect to prm.vim
	mv ~/.vim/ftdetect/prm.vim_ftdetect ~/.vim/ftdetect/prm.vim

# Complete!
	printf "Complete!\n Please make sure syntax highlighting is turned on in vim\n"
